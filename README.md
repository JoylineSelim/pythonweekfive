Activity 2
# Base class: Vehicle
class Vehicle:
    def move(self):
        pass  # Placeholder method to be overridden by child classes

# Derived class: Car (inherits from Vehicle)
class Car(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        print("Driving üöó")

# Derived class: Plane (inherits from Vehicle)
class Plane(Vehicle):
    def move(self):
        print("Flying ‚úàÔ∏è")

# Create objects of the Car and Plane classes
car = Car()
plane = Plane()

# Call the move method for each
car.move()  # Output: Driving üöó
plane.move()  # Output: Flying ‚úàÔ∏è
